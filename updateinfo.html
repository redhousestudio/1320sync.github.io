<p># 1. Keep your personal notes in the app along the cycles!<br />
# 2. Added links and teachers added to learn more about the cycles. Enjoy!</p>
<p>NEW:<br />
- Addition of personal notes! Now you can keep your personal notes on the 2 main cycles of the Mayan Calendar: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. You can keep a diary with memoirs, anecdotes, anniversaries, combined Kin calculations, special synchronicities, intense experiences or anything that is relevant for your synchronotron. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes. This is a feature that you can buy to keep the code alive.<br />

- New Castles and Wavespell view where you can zoom in and out in the 5*4*13=260 cycles. Tap on the Wavespell labels to show the Wavespell and its Castle displayed. Use the plus and minus buttons to zoom in or out. You can also swipe up and down to zoom.<br />
- Added Time cells .. back again!<br />
- Added insight into the positions of all Seals of the the Destiny Oracle. Tap to make bigger.<br />
- Added manual app language setting! Finally you can choose, in the app, what language you want to use to sync along the cycles.<br />
- Selection buttons that allow quick selection of Kin in the whole app. (The little arrow in the left bottom corner).</p>
