title: A worthy legacy for Jose Arguelles
description: >
  <p>Beautifully articulated, brilliantly conceived. I met its creator, Jose Arguelles, at the Prophets' Conference in Vancouver a few months before he passed in Feb. 2011. .. Hugging him was like hugging a cloud. He did not get to experience 2012 from this side, but he personally handed me this calendar as a small pamphlet.<br />Wonderful to use it now in app form.</p>
